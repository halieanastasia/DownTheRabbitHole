	This game works by reading your input.
	It parses out different words and classifies them as a type of action [Keyword, Verb, Character, Location, Item, or Direction ]
	Then the computer uses that input to figure out what to do next.
		
	The game only keeps track of the last word entered from each category
	Therefore it is best to enter actions one at a time
		Example: The game will read [go north and talk to rabbit], as talk to rabbit
		
Tips	
	If you want two words to be considered as one entry use a hyphen 
		Example: north-east or south-west
	To unlock a door you need the right key		
	To unlock a door you must specify the direction, try structureing your response like "Unlock the southern door"
