Starting game...

You are in a meadow filled with wildflowers the air smells like sunshine and over ripe berries.
You've just woken up from a long nap in a meadow filled with wildflowers and tall grass.
 You look around for your sister but she is no where to be found.
 You notice that while you slept she has placed a daisy crown upon your head.
 Just when you begin to wake up a white rabbit runs by muttering about the time.
 How odd, you think, how does he keep track of the time, surely without thumbs he can't hold a pocket watch properly.

What do you want to do next?
> talk to rabbit
You start talking to The White Rabbit
"I am very late", the rabbit exclaims.

First you scan the perimeter and make a mental note of all of the exits:
To the *south* there is a trail of tall grass with a trail of rabbit prints leading to the west.
It looks like it might lead to a rabbit hole

Next you look around to see if there is anyone else here with you:
A nervous-looking white rabbit with pink eyes and an iridescent pocket watch.

Down
Down

Finally you land in what appears to be a giant cupcake, you are sticky but uninjured.
You are in the bottom of a deep, dark rabbit hole.
Maybe you should try exploring the area.

Finally you look around to see if there is anything useful here that you can take with you:
A broken jar of marmalade. It is sharp and still a little sticky.
A little golden pocket watch on a thin gold chain. Its clock face appears to be constellations rather than hours of the day.

Input instructions
        This game works by reading your input.
        It parses out different words and classifies them as a type of action [Keyword, Verb, Character, Location, Item, or Direction ]
        Then the computer uses that input to figure out what to do next.

        The game only keeps track of the last word entered from each category
        Therefore it is best to enter actions one at a time
                Example: The game will read [go north and talk to rabbit], as talk to rabbit

Tips
        If you want two words to be considered as one entry use a hyphen
                Example: north-east or south-west
        To unlock a door you need the right key
        To unlock a door you must specify the direction, try structuring your response like "Unlock the southern door"

A group of card gardeners, are anxiously painting white roses red. The White Rabbit scurries frantically southward, muttering about being very-very late for the trial.

You watch as a royal procession passes by, first the courtiers dripping in diamonds
After them come the royal children, skipping along in pairs, adorned with hearts.
Then the guests, mostly Kings and Queens.
Following them, the soldier of Hearts carries the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion.
At last, the Queen of hearts comes into view.
When everyone has arrived you realize they are setting up to play the strangest game of croquet you have ever encountered
They are using hedgehogs as the balls and pink flamingos as the clubs
